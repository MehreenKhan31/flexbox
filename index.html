<h3>Gymnastics</h3>
<div><i>Gymnastics is a type of sport that includes physical exercises
     requiring balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, 
     and endurance. The movements involved in gymnastics contribute to
      the development of the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest, and
       abdominal muscle groups. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used
        by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and 
        dismounting a horse, and from circus performance skills.</i></div>

            <h3> Badminton</h3>
            <div><i>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock 
                across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the 
                game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per
                 side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court.
                Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before
                 it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock 
                 has struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been
                  called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the
                   opposing side.[1]</i></div>
